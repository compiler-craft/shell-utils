### Guide lines:
	1. the plugin manager should keep in one top directory
	2. install script should be robust and most compatible
	3. the startup should contain debug functionability such as list the loaded functions and libraries
	4. should keep effeciency in mind, so compile needed
	5. code should be documented, generate help file from source file
	6. interface skel help func to system access, such as help in bash and run-help in zsh
	7. cause there's many perl script in /bin and /usr/bin, so the skel implemented in perl, if needed, can be rewrite in C/C++
